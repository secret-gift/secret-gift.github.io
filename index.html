	<p class="padding">Hope you are well and doing better than before, be it physically or mentally. Making a sketch this time was too draining for me emotionally when even looking at our pictures makes me feel upset in the stomach because those days are gone now. But I thought I should still try as I won't get a chance again I guess. In case this gift makes you feel uneasy, I apologize in advance. I tried my best to keep it simple so you don't feel emotionally attacked or something and I am not sending this to you with any kind of unfair intentions to make you feel a certain way. I just wanted to send you some happy words because it feels like the last time to me. Who knows if we'll be alive next year or not, you'll be around/reachable next year or not. The way things are, humans may go extinct before next time comes, so even though I think you probably won't like it, I am taking the risk. <br> I hope your mom, sisters, dad and everyone important to you is doing well. On the same note, I'd like to add something very important. My college is working with the NSS units of several colleges and some NGOs to help out people in need of covid support by connecting suppliers, plasma donors etc. with patients. I am also volunteering for the same and get hourly updates about it. I really really hope that you never need it (fingers crossed), but if ever, worst case scenario, anyone known to you ever needs any kind of covid-support, you can count me in the list of people who might be of any help. Well, with that, the most important part is done. I had a lot of words I thought I'd be saying here but it's all blank now that I am typing this. Anyway, I won't make it very long and boring like I used to do. Mush recovered back then, I shouldn't have made such a fuss back then.<br> Do not contact me even if this gift made you upset. I hope there's someone out there who'd call you at 12am sharp and give you lots of happy wishes and blessings so that you don't remember the bad times you ever had, because of me or anything else. <br>I used to blame you a lot, but remember, however things turned out, you, me, the circumstances are all to be blamed for that. It's everyone's fault. So whenever you feel like giving up on yourself or that you're not a good person, I hope you will be courageous enough to get up and try to improve things again and find strength in who you are. Things never last forever. If nothing, I'll always keep you in my heart as a good but distant friend that lives in another world. After all, you taught me so many good and bad things about life. I probably couldn't pay you back enough in return and gave you more bad memories than good ones, but I hope you'll be able to heal from them.
<br> May the 28th year of your life bring you a brand new perspective and positivity that lasts a life-time!! I hope you keep doing the right thing for yourself and your loved ones and remain calm.<br> <br> <br>
I will pray that you find the peace and strength to forgive and forget all the hurt you felt or still feel because of my existence. I will pray that you find warmth again and never ever lose it. <br>Have a happy and peaceful year and a beautiful life ahead Baka.
